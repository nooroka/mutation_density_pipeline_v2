dbSNP mutation density pipeline <br>
The  <b>Snakemake</b> pipeline (Snakemake* files for different types of data) was developed for automatically processing the experimental data. It takes as an input the experimental and the whole-genome data (GRCh37/GRCh38 assemblies) and outputs the file with mutational density for each chromosome for G4-quadruplexes and control sets, coordinates of G4-quadruplexes and control sequences.
